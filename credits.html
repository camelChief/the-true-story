                    <p>Hi! Caleb Campbell, that's me! I'm responsible for the creation of this site, including the images used in the story. I am 18, currently studying at the University of Queensland and living in Brisbane. I moved down from Gladstone earlier this year to begin my first year of a Bachelor of Information Technology. Before this I took a gap year, traveling and saving for uni. To date this is my most successful website project, and as such I won't be listing any other projects I've completed here.</p>
                    <p>I have a passion for almost anything involving writing code, and designing graphics, and cannot wait to get further into my course at UQ. Some of my other interests include unicycling, NRL, the <strong>gorgeous</strong> Fiat Nuova 500 and cycling.</p>
                    <p>When creating the site, I used standard procedure, writing most of the HTML first, then building upon that base with CSS and Javascript. I then used Inkscape to create all the images used in the story, and make them interactive and fun. This site functions best on modern browsers which support Javascript, and looks best in full-screen.</p>
