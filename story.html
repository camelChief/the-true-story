        <p>Everybody knows the story of the Three Little Pigs.</p>
        <p>Or at least they think they do.</p>
        <p>But I'll let you in on a little secret.</p>
        <p>Nobody knows the <strong>real</strong> story,</p>
        <p>because nobody has heard <strong>my</strong> side of the story.</p>
        <img id="page1" class="story" src="images/page1.png" alt="Wolf in prison.">
        
        <p>I'm the wolf. <strong>Alexander T. Wolf</strong>.</p>
        <p>You can call me Al.</p>
        <p>I don't know how this whole <strong>Big Bad Wolf</strong> thing got started,</p>
        <p>but it's all wrong.</p>
        <img id="page2" class="story" src="images/page2.png" alt="Alexander T. Wolf">
        
        <p>Maybe it's because of our diet.</p>
        <p>Hey, it's not my fault wolves eat cute little animals like bunnies and sheep and pigs.</p>
        <p>That's just the way we are.</p>
        <p>If cheeseburgers were cute, folks would probably think you were Big and Bad, too.</p>
        <img id="page3" class="story" src="images/page3.png" alt="Cute burger.">
        
        <p>But like I was saying, the whole Big Bad Wolf thing is all wrong.</p>
        <p>The real story is about a sneeze and a cup of sugar.</p>
        <img id="page4" class="story" src="images/page4.png" alt="Sneeze and sugar.">
        
        <h1>This is the Real Story</h1>
        
        <p>Way back in Once Upon a Time time,</p>
        <p>I was making a birthday cake for my dear old granny.</p>
        <p>I had a terrible sneezing cold.</p>
        <p>I ran out of sugar.</p>
        <img id="page5" class="story" src="images/page5.png" alt="Cute burger.">
        
        <p>So I walked down the street to ask my neighbor for a cup of sugar.</p>
        <p>Now this neighbor was a pig.</p>
        <p>And he wasn't too bright, either.</p>
        <p>He had built his whole house out of <strong>straw</strong>.</p>
        <p>Can you believe it?</p>
        <p>I mean who in his right mind would build a house of straw?</p>
        <img id="page6" class="story" src="images/page6.png" alt="Landscape.">
        
        <p>So of course the minute I knocked on the door, it fell right in.</p>
        <p>I didn't want to just walk into someone else's house.</p>
        <p>So I called, <strong>"Little Pig, Little Pig, are you in?"</strong></p>
        <p>No answer.</p>
        <p>I was just about to go home without the cup of sugar for my dear old granny's birthday cake.</p>
        <a href="index.html"><img id="page7" class="story" src="images/page7.png" alt="First Pig's house."></a>
        
        <!-- <p>31 That's when my nose started to itch.</p>
        <p>32 I felt a sneeze coming on.</p>
        <p>33 Well I huffed.</p>
        <p>34 And I snuffed.</p>
        <img id="page8" class="story" src="images/page8.png" alt="Cute burger.">
        
        <p>35 And I sneezed a great sneeze.</p>
        <img id="page9" class="story" src="images/page9.png" alt="Cute burger.">
        
        <p>36 And you know what?</p>
        <p>37 The whole darn straw house fell down.</p>
        <p>38 And right in the middle of the pile of the straw was the First Little Pig -</p>
        <p>39 <strong>dead as a doornail</strong>.</p>
        <p>40 He had been home the whole time.</p>
        <img id="page10" class="story" src="images/page10.png" alt="Cute burger.">
        
        <p>41 It seemed like a shame to leave a perfectly good ham dinner lying there in the straw.</p>
        <p>42 So I ate it up.</p>
        <p>43 Think of it as a big cheeseburger just lying there.</p>
        <img id="page11" class="story" src="images/page11.png" alt="Cute burger.">
        
        <p>44 I was feeling a little better.</p>
        <p>45 But I still didn't have my cup of sugar.</p>
        <p>46 So I went to the next neighbor's house.</p>
        <p>47 This neighbor was the First Little Pig's brother.</p>
        <p>48 He was a little smarter, but not much.</p>
        <p>49 He had built his house of sticks.</p>
        <img id="page12" class="story" src="images/page12.png" alt="Cute burger.">
        
        <p>50 I rang the bell on the stick house.</p>
        <p>51 Nobody answered.</p>
        <p>52 I called, "Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig, are you in?"</p>
        <p>53 He yelled back, "Go away wolf. You can't come in. I'm shaving the hairs on my chinny chin chin."</p>
        <img id="page13" class="story" src="images/page13.png" alt="Cute burger.">
        
        <p>54 I had just grabbed the doorknob when I felt another sneeze coming on.</p>
        <p>55 I huffed.</p>
        <p>56 And I snuffed.</p>
        <p>57 And I tried to cover my mouth, but I sneezed a great sneeze.</p>
        <img id="page14" class="story" src="images/page14.png" alt="Cute burger.">
        
        <p>58 And you're not going to believe it,</p>
        <p>59 but this guy's house fell down just like his brother's.</p>
        <p>60 When the dust cleared, there was the Second Little Pig -</p>
        <p>61 <strong>dead as a doornail.</strong></p>
        <p>62 Wolf's honor.</p>
        <img id="page15" class="story" src="images/page14.png" alt="Cute burger.">
        
        <p>63 Now you know food will spoil if you just leave it out in the open.</p>
        <p>64 So I did the only thing there was to do.</p>
        <p>65 I had dinner again.</p>
        <p>66 Think of it as a second helping.</p>
        <p>67 I was getting awfully full.</p>
        <p>68 But my cold was feeling a little better.</p>
        <p>69 And I still didn't have that cup of sugar for my dear old granny's birthday cake.</p>
        <p>70 So I went to the next house.</p>
        <p>71 This guy was the First and Second Little Pig's brother.</p>
        <p>72 He must have been the brains of the family.</p>
        <p>73 He had built his house of bricks.</p>
        
        <p>74 I knocked on the brick house.</p>
        <p>75 No answer.</p>
        <p>76 I called, "Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig, are you in?"</p>
        <p>77 And do you know what that rude little porker answered?</p>
        <p>78 "Get out of here, Wolf. Don't bother me again."</p>
        <img id="page17" class="story" src="images/page14.png" alt="Cute burger.">
        
        <p>79 Talk about impolite!</p>
        <p>80 He probably had a whole sackful of sugar.</p>
        <p>81 And he wouldn't give me even one little cup for my dear sweet old granny's birthday cake.</p>
        <p>82 What a pig!</p>
        <p>83 I was just about to go home and maybe make a nice birthday card instead of a cake,</p>
        <p>84 when I felt my cold coming on.</p>
        <p>85 I huffed.</p>
        <p>86 And I snuffed.</p>
        <p>87 And I sneezed once again.</p>
        <p>88 Then the Third Little Pig yelled, "And your old granny can sit on a pin!"</p>
        
        <p>89 Now I'm usually a pretty calm fellow.</p>
        <p>90 But when somebody talks about my granny like that, I go a little crazy.</p>
        <p>91 When the cops drove up, of course I was trying to break down this Pig's door.</p>
        <p>92 And the whole time I was huffing and puffing and sneezing and making a real scene.</p>
        <img id="page17" class="story" src="images/page14.png" alt="Cute burger.">
        
        <p>93 The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
        
        <p>94 The news reporters found out about the two pigs I had for dinner.</p>
        <p>95 They figured a sick guy going to borrow a cup of sugar didn't sound very exciting.</p>
        <p>96 So they jazzed up the story with all of that "Huff and puff and blow your house down."</p>
        <p>97 And they made me the Big Bad Wolf.</p>
        <p>98 That's it.</p>
        <p>99 The real story. I was framed.</p>
        <img id="page17" class="story" src="images/page14.png" alt="Cute burger.">
        
        <p>100 But maybe you could loan me a cup of sugar.</p>
