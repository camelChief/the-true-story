# The True Story
The True Story of the Three Little Pigs - an interactive children's story.

This was a website I developed for a course I studied last year. It is based off of the story (under the same name) by Jon Scieszka. I created the website entirely myself, including the cartoon images as seen in the interactive story.

The story cuts short because we were not required to complete the full story if it was longer than a few pages.
